## Set up Python environment with Anaconda 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 

## Script components
To run a script, a file path in the script should be modified to be consistent with an attempted directory.

### 1. data
This directory contains scripts to construct the OMG database from [eMolecules](https://www.emolecules.com/).

### 2. scscore
This directory contains a script to calculate SC score obtained from https://github.com/connorcoley/scscore.

### 3. polymerization
This directory contains the OMG polymerization algorithms.

### 4. selfies 
This directory contains modified SELFIES scripts to incorporate asterisk (*). The asterisk rules were added to the original work, https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies

### 5. molecule_chef 
This directory contains the Molecule Chef generative model. The scripts were written referring to the original work,
[Bradshaw, J.; Paige, B.; Kusner, M. J.; Segler, M.; Hern√°ndez-Lobato, J. M. A Model to Search for Synthesizable Molecules. 
In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Curran Associates, Inc., 2019; Vol. 32.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05221), 
and their scripts, https://github.com/john-bradshaw/molecule-chef.

### 6. vae 
This directory contains a variational autoencoder model. The scripts were written referring to https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies/blob/master/examples/vae_example/chemistry_vae.py

### 7. train
This directory contains scripts to train Molecule Chef and SELFIES VAE. These scripts were written by referring to 
https://github.com/john-bradshaw/molecule-chef and https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies/blob/master/examples/vae_example/chemistry_vae.py.
